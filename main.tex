\section*{\hfil Abstract \hfil}
\vspace{1cm}
In this work we tried to identify the facial expression of a person from a given static image. Facial expression plays a very important role for conducting a successful communication. An automatic facial expression recognizer can help a machine to understand the emotion of a person. So, it will allow the machine to act in a more optimized way. In our work we implemented a system that can identify the facial expression of a person. The system was implemented using two different techniques: SVM and CNN. We used Haar-like feature for extracting the face portion. Our system can also identify the expression of bearded person. We trained and tested our dataset on JAFFE, CK+ and our own created bearded face image. Using SVM technique we got 82.22\%, 85.88\% and 71.43\% accuracy and using CNN techniques we got 90.47\%, 89.41\% an 72.00\% accuracy on JAFFE, CK+ and our own created bearded image dataset consecutively.
